Archon Prison:

* Gridwork each cell either empty or containing a prisoner
* Prisoner has a strategy for co-operating or defecting
* In each round, a Prisoner interacts (sequentially) with each neighbour, using their strategy, with standard Prisoner's Dilemma rules
* After each round, if your score is (strictly?) higher than your neighbours (look into thisâ€¦), they are erased and replaced with copies of you 
* What happens if you are surrounded with empty cells (is this possible?)
* Inspired by Nick Eames
